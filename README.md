# <center> KIT InvasIC Deep Learning Practical </center> 

This is the notebook for tutorials and exercises which should be used as the supplements to the  KIT InvasIC machine learning workshop. 
In order to ease you from having a GPU server and from installing libraries needed to run the code, I recommend that you should use [Paperspace's Gradient](https://gradient.paperspace.com/), a free-GPU MLaaS platform. 

So please read the instructions [here](HowtoGradientPaperspace.pdf) about how to set up the notebook with Gradient.

But in case that you are familiar with how to install python libraries for deep learning and you have some laptop with deep learning-compatible GPUs, you can run those notebooks with your machine. 

## Installing Prerequisites

I highly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads) (a python scientific package bundle) and use its environment managing feature.

### Anaconda

* Anaconda with python 3.5 (or 3.6)
* CUDA drivers & toolkit 8.0 (if your workstation is Nvidia GPU-enabled or you use our lab machines)

If you are not sure what you are doing, please refer to the steps 1-5 from https://towardsdatascience.com/setup-an-environment-for-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-with-anaconda-in-windows-5d7134a3db10

### Jupyter Notebooks

The tutorials and exerises have been published as Jupyter Notebooks.
If you haven't used Jupyter Notebooks before, here is a good tutorial for beginners: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/

### Prerequisites

Install inside the environment those python packages which are needed thoughout the class:
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn 
* other stuffs that you need..

### Install Pytorch and torchvision (using Anaconda)

<span style="color:red">We use **Pytorch 0.4** , or **Pytorch 1.0**, not other versions.</span> 

* Create an Anaconda environment
* Activate it
* Install [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) in a suitable way (conda, python version, GPU or not)
