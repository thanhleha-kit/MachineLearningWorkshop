    "On this exercise, you are going to apply what you learn from the <code>numpy</code> tutorial in the implementation of L2-regularized Logistic Least Squares Regression (LLSR). I will provide you the formula by now but you can look at that in the practical lecture, the computational graph part. First you should use pens and papers to vectorize them. Then you implement the full of the classifier based on your vectorized version.\n",

    "L2-regularized Logistic Least Squares Regression is similar to the standard Logistic Regression: It is a binary classifier containing only one layer, mapping the input features to only one output using sigmoid function. The differents here are two things: </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of the _binary crossentropy error_ for the loss, it uses the _squared error_.\n",

    "Note that we will do an SGD training for this exercise. More specifically:\n",
    "* There are $m$ data instance on the training set, each has $n$ input features. \n",
    "* $x_{i}^{(j)}$ denotes the $i^{th}$ input feature of the $j^{th}$ data instance.\n",
    "* $y^{(j)}$ denotes the binary label ($0$ or $1$) of the $j^{th}$ data instance.\n",
    "* $w_{i}$ denotes the weight connecting the $i^{th}$ input feature to the output.\n",
    "* $b$ is the bias of the Logistic Least Squares Regression.\n",

    "     * The final loss function is L2-regularized: $l^{(j)} = \\frac{1}{2}c^{(j)} + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i^2$. \n",
    "     * Update the weights: \n",
    "         * Loop over every weight $w_i$ and update once at a time: $w_i = w_i - \\eta((o^{(j)}-y^{(j)})o^{(j)}(1-o^{(j)})x_i^{(j)} + \\lambda w_i)$\n",
